# Fiscal-DSGE
## Data 

- "data_request_06112023" contains the raw macro and fiscal data. The first sheet "Transformations" pulls the data from the different sheets and calculates the log differences, differences, or % change used for estimation.

- "2023_Estimation9323" contains the transformed data used for estimation. MATLAB will read this file (or an equivalent .m file) when called for estimation purposes.

- "Raw_data - original" contains the original data set from Kemp & Hollander (2020). Although data was revised subsequently and there was a re-basing of the QB data, the series largely correspond and have not appeared to significantly influence results.

- "data_revise_22012024": contains Compensation of Employment and Employment series from SARB to get alternative remuneration per worker. Transformations are in this file as well.
